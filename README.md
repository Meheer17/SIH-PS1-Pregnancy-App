# AI-Powered Reproductive Health Platform

## Executive Summary

Our team has developed a comprehensive maternal health monitoring solution that bridges the gap between expectant mothers and healthcare providers. The system offers a holistic approach to pregnancy care through a mobile application that integrates prenatal tracking, postnatal support, and remote monitoring capabilities. By leveraging portable ECG technology and intuitive tracking features, we aim to improve maternal health outcomes, especially in underserved communities.

We have already developed several mobile applications for the doctors of Saveetha University Hospital, based on the specific requirements of each department. These applications are available on both the Play Store and App Store for use by doctors and patients. We now propose to integrate all these features into a unified master project, with a focus on addressing prenatal and postnatal health issues, particularly for rural populations. This initiative will leverage AI integration to enable local offline access, ensuring better healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings.

## Objective

- Build an AI-powered reproductive health platform to reduce infant mortality through improved prenatal and postnatal care.
- Support PCOS management for women with digital tools (symptom tracking, diet, exercise, guided interventions).
- Implement deep learning and federated learning-based semen analysis for predicting male fertility.
- Enable offline health predictions via Federated Learning for areas with limited internet access.
- Empower healthcare providers and health workers with real-time dashboards, patient monitoring tools, and mobile accessibility.
- Bridge the healthcare gap between rural populations and medical institutions through telemedicine and remote diagnostics.

## Key Features Implemented

### Comprehensive Pregnancy Monitoring

Our system provides a full suite of pregnancy monitoring tools:
- Weight tracking with trend analysis

### Fetal Growth Tracking

We've developed an interactive fetal growth chart that allows mothers to visualize their baby's development throughout pregnancy. The system:
- Tracks key developmental milestones by week
- Provides personalized growth charts based on initial measurements
- Compares growth metrics against standard percentiles
- Offers educational content about fetal development stages
- Alerts healthcare providers to potential growth concerns

### Technical Implementation

The application architecture follows a user-centric design with multiple interconnected modules:
1. Registration System - Supports both online self-registration and offline registration with health worker assistance
2. Authentication & Login - Secure access to personal health information
3. Document Verification - Medical history validation and demographic data collection
4. Dashboard - Central hub for all monitoring features
5. Support Systems - Including chatbot assistance and emergency SOS functionality
6. Telemedicine Integration - Direct communication with healthcare providers

## Summary

This project proposes a smart, AI-driven mobile platform aimed at reducing infant mortality and addressing reproductive health issues for both women and men. The application provides a holistic solution covering:

- Prenatal and postnatal monitoring
- High-risk pregnancy alerts
- PCOS symptom tracking, QOL assessment, diet/exercise guidance
- Deep learning-based semen analysis and fertility prediction
- Real-time monitoring using portable ECG devices
- Infant growth tracking and immunization management
- Telemedicine and community support modules

The platform is designed for both urban and rural deployment, offering online and offline support using federated learning for secure local AI predictions. It integrates multiple stakeholders—pregnant women, doctors, healthcare workers, and administrators—into a centralized system with analytics, content, and communication tools.

## Healthcare Impact

Our solution addresses several critical challenges in maternal healthcare:
- **Accessibility:** Enables remote monitoring for patients in rural areas
- **Early Detection:** Identifies potential complications before they become critical
- **Continuous Care:** Maintains patient-provider connection between appointments
- **Education:** Empowers mothers with knowledge about their pregnancy
- **Mental Health Support:** Includes screening tools and resources for postpartum depression

- **Security:** Role-based access, encrypted storage, consent-based sharing

## Portable ECG Integration

A standout feature of our solution is the integration with portable ECG devices for remote monitoring:
- Enables real-time ECG data transmission to healthcare providers
- Allows for early detection of cardiac abnormalities
- Supports continuous monitoring for high-risk pregnancies
- Includes automated analysis to flag potential concerns
- Stores historical data for trending and comparative analysis

## Societal & Industrial Impact

### Societal Impact

- Reduce preventable infant deaths through early detection and health education.
- Empower women with cycle awareness, PCOS management, and reproductive education.
- Include male fertility for gender-equal responsibility in pregnancy planning.
- Improve rural accessibility via offline AI predictions and health worker modules.
- Promote mental health awareness for mothers post-delivery.

### Industrial Impact

- Scalable as a GovTech health solution for national/state health departments.
- Useful for healthcare startups and digital clinics to integrate AI-based diagnostics.
- Potential integration with insurance providers and EHR systems.
- Opportunities for medical device manufacturers to integrate with ECG and fertility devices.
- Sets a precedent for AI + Federated Learning in maternal care and fertility tech.

## Scalability & Market Readiness

- Device-agnostic and operable in low-resource settings.
- Launchable as B2B for hospitals or B2C for end users.
- Compatible with government health schemes (e.g., Ayushman Bharat, CM Health Cards).
- Modular architecture for wearable integrations (e.g., glucose monitors, Dopplers).
- API support for third-party devices and hospital systems.
- Market potential across maternal health, fertility tech, rural health tech, and insurance analytics.

## Technology Utilization
